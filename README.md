## Intro

For the stock movement prediction problem, the input is a series of historical stock data, and the goal
is to predict whether the stock price will trend up or
down in the following trading days. Asset management companies and investment banks are steadily
increasing their research funding into artificial intelligence, particularly focusing on deep learning models,
since higher model accuracies often mean increased
profitability. Additionally, trained deep learning
models can serve as the backend for automated trading bots, capable to make real-time trading decisions

The goal of this research project is to benchmark
the performance of recently developed deep learning
models in stock movement prediction on established
benchmark datasets. The stretch goal is to evaluate the profitability of trading based on the modelsâ€™
predictions on the market data for this year.

Please refer to the [project's final report](Stock_Prediction.pdf) for additional context.
